# HOPSCOTCH
Hopscotch is a web application that employs machine learning to evaluate the students based on their performance.
It consists of three modules: student, guardian (could be a teacher or parent), and admin. 
Hopscotch assesses students' reading, spelling, visual processing, and mathematical abilities using the materials provided. 
It also includes a questionnaire for guardians (can be their parents or teachers). 
One of our goals is to compare various models in order to find the most effective one.
 Hopscotch has the potential to help parents, teachers, and school officials identify and diagnose children's problems early on.
 Thank you :))
